```go
# my_struct_is_awesome.go
package util

type MyStruct struct {
  A string
  B int
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Package Declaration:** We define `MyStruct` within the `util` package, matching the package used in `util_test.go`. This ensures both files can access each other.

- **Struct Definition:** We create a struct named `MyStruct` with two fields:
  - `A string `json:"a"``: This field represents the "a" key from your JSON data and is tagged with `json:"a"` to ensure it's mapped correctly during JSON unmarshalling.
  - `B int `json:"b"``: Similarly, this represents the "b" key from your JSON data.

**How this Works:**

1. **JSON Unmarshaling:** When you run `json.Unmarshal(b, &s)`, it takes the JSON data (`b`) and tries to populate the fields of your `MyStruct` instances. Because of the `json:"a"` and `json:"b"` tags, it correctly maps the values from the JSON file into the corresponding struct fields.

2. **JSON Marshaling:** The `json.Marshal(&s)` call takes your slice of `MyStruct` objects (`s`) and converts them back into a JSON representation, which should match the original `testdata/test.json` file.
